Installing & Configuring Gulp for your local Drupal 8 project


1.Install Gulp globally so the "gulp" command can be run from any project 
    - In your command line program, type "npm install gulp-cli -g" 
    - Test your installation by typing "gulp -v" in your command line program

2. Navigate to the current theme directory
	- Use the command prompt to navigate to the theme you will be using by typing "cd themes/THEMENAME" (e.g cd themes/lao").
	- the following commands will be executed in this directory

5. Initialize npm using the command prompt
	- in the command prompt, type "npm init"
	- You will be asked a series of questions. Enter a value or hit Enter to accept defaults.

4. Install Gulp Locally
	- type "npm install gulp --save-dev"
	- This installs Gulp as a development dependency and it updates the "devDependencies" section of package.json

5. Create a Gulp Configuration File
	- in this case, use the gulpfile.js provided.


Using this gulpfile

1. npm install -S gulp-sass gulp-autoprefixer browser-sync
